# Animation Tutorials
This is a full stack (SANE) app built using Angular, Node, Express, Massive, & SQL. I also taught myself JQuery, Greensock, &
custom CSS animations for this project. 

First and foremost this project was an opportunity to build a full stack application using the above technologies. The tutorials
are laid out in the following pattern:
1. I show the animation in action
2. I show the code I used to create that animation
3. I explain the thought process behind the animation and the code.
