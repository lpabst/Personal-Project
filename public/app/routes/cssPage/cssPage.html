            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>Css makes the website <span id='css_pretty'>pretty</span>! While it's mainly used for styling the webpage
                and sizing/positioning everything on the page a certain way, it can also be 
                used for animations! While we won't be getting into the styling aspects of CSS
                here, we will learn about CSS animations.</p>
            <P> To Learn CSS basics, such as styling,
                check out 
                <a href='https://codecademy.com' target='_blank'>CodeCademy</a> 
                or <a href='https://w3schools.com/css/default.asp' target='_blank'>W3Schools</a>! 
                Using one of the Javascript languages offers a lot more 
                power and versatility in what kinds of animations you can do, but CSS is
                simple, and blazingly fast.  This makes it a great option for any simple 
                animations.</p>
            <p>Css is limited however.  If you want to click a button and carry out some
                effect somewhere on the page, you will need to use Javascript (or any 
                of the JS libraries like JQuery/Angular/Greensock). Let's explore some of the
                options we have with CSS though!</p>
            <div class='css_examplebox' id='css_box1'>Hover Effect</div>
            <img src='./img/css/css_example1.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <p>Here we have 3 blocks of code. The first is the styling. All of my example boxes
                on this page will share the same class (css_examplebox) for their initial styling.
                This real fun happens in code-blocks 2 & 3!</p>
            <p>From here, I can use their id (css_box1, css_box2, etc) to give them specific
                instructions, such as a background color, and transition duration.  Transition: all
                0.4s basically says, for ALL transitions on this element, take 0.4 seconds to 
                get there, and 0.4 seconds to get back. </p>
            <p>So when we hover (code-block 3), we are changing the background color, 
                and increasing the entire element by a scale of 1.1. It takes 0.4 
                seconds to do that, and when your mouse leaves the element, 0.4 seconds
                again to go back to the original state.
            </p>
            <p>Css is great for hover effects. If you want slight changes when the user is
                hovering over an element- such as having a menu item light up when they hover
                over it to let them know it is clickable- use CSS.  It is fast, easy, and 
                doesn't require a bunch of extra code!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class='css_animation_wrapper'>
            <h2>Click Events</h2>
            <p>Click events are pretty limited with CSS. We can use 'active' to imitate
                what a click event would look like, but only on the element we are clicking.
                When you click on an element, that element becomes 'active', so you can style
                it accordingly. Css doesn't have a native way to affect the DOM in general
                with a click event however.</p>          
            <div class='css_examplebox' id='css_box2'>Active Effect</div>
            <div class='css_examplebox' id='css_box3'>Active Effect</div>
            <img src='./img/css/css_example2.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <p>I made two boxes to demonstrate some different properties we can use with
                the CSS 'transform' property! This one is a lot of fun, and allows us to 
                do some really cool animations. You will notice that the purple box seems
                to swing away from the webpage in a 3D motion.</p>
            <p> To accomplish this, we give the containing element (the parent div) a 
                property of 'perspective: 1000px;'. The amount of pixels determines how 
                close you are to the effect. Smaller pixel values will result in a really large,
                spectacular animation. Both boxes have a left margin, and transition durations 
                specified.</p>
            <p>Box 2 (green) rotates clockwise 20 degrees when it is active. Once it's not active
                anymore, it goes back to starting position. You will also notice that I included
                a 'transform-origin' property, which specifies where to rotate from. This is 
                why that top left corner stays fixed while the rest of it swings, as if a nail
                in the top right corner just fell out!</p>
            <p>Box 3 (purple) rotates on the y axis. Transform-origin has been set to left, 
                making it swing on the left side instead of in the middle. Since it is swinging
                'away' from the webpage, the perspective that we set on the parent element 
                comes into effect. Box 2 doesn't swing away from us, so it doesn't have any
                effect on that one.</p>
