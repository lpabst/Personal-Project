            <h2>Tweenlite.to</h2>
            <p>Greensock uses JQuery selectors, and integrates very well with JQuery.
                We use $('#id or .class') to select an element. We use TweenLite.to in 
                the following format - TweenLite.to(element, delay, attributes). So we select
                our element, state the duration, and say what we want to happen. In this 
                case we changed the CSS property 'left' to 200.</p>
            <div class='examplebox_wrapper'>
                <div class='examplebox' id='greensock_box1'>.to()</div>
            </div>
            <img src='./img/greensock/greensock_example1.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <p>So What if we wanted to chain effects? We can use the 'delay' method inside
                of the effect like this: {left:200, delay:2}. This would change 'left'' to
                200, but only after a 2 second delay. So chaining commands becomes as simple 
                as listing effects one after the other. Let's look at that next!</p>
        </div>   

        <div class='animation_wrapper'>
            <h2>Chaining effects</h2>
            <div class='examplebox_wrapper'>
                <div class='examplebox' id='greensock_box2'>Click Me!!!</div>
            </div>
            <img src='./img/greensock/greensock_example2.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <p>With this example we threw in a few new components! We select the box and
                save it to a variable so that the computer doesn't have to go searching for 
                it each time we want to do something with it.</p>
            <p>Next, we use a JQuery click function to initiate the sequence of animations. 
                After that, it's as simple as listing one animation after the other. We insert 
                the 'delay' statement right in line with the CSS declarations we want to change.
                For this example, I have the delays set to the same amount of time it takes all
                of the previous animations to complete, but you could put whatever time you want 
                there.</p>
            <div class='examplebox_wrapper'>
                <div class='examplebox' id='greensock_box3'>Click Me!!!</div>
            </div>
            <p>Another way to chain events is to use the 'onComplete'
                method. Once the animation is done, it will fire off whatever function you put 
                in there. In this case, I have each function referring to the other one once it's 
                complete, so they just go back and forth, infinitely!
            <img src='./img/greensock/greensock_example3.PNG' alt='picture of code' style='margin-top:10px'>
        </div>   

        <div class='animation_wrapper'>
            <h2>Tweenlite.from</h2>
            <p>TweenLite.from(element, duration, attributes). We use this for a slightly different
                purpose. Instead of going TO the attributes we put in, it will come FROM them, to
                whatever location/state it is in when the animation is initiated.</p>
            <p>So when you push the button, it comes FROM left:200px, back to it's starting position
                of left:105px. But what if you push the button again in the middle of the animation?
                Whereever the box is at when you push the button, that will be its new end point. It
                will come FROM left:200px to that point.</p>
            <div class='examplebox_wrapper'>
                <div class='examplebox' id='greensock_box4'>.from()</div>
                <button id='gs_example4_btn'>Start Animation</button>
            </div>
            <img src='./img/greensock/greensock_example4.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <p>Let's try something a little more complicated!</p>
        </div>  

        <div class='animation_wrapper'>
            <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
            <button id='plant_example_btn' style='margin-bottom:10px'>Go</button>
            <button id='plant_reset_btn'>Reset</button>
            <div class='greensock_plant_animation'>
                <div class='sky'>
                    <div class='sun'></div>
                </div>
                <div class='ground'>
                    <div class='stem'>
                        <div class='petal a'></div>
                        <div class='petal b'></div>
                        <div class='petal c'></div>
                        <div class='leaf'></div>
                        <div class='mini_stem'></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <img src='./img/greensock/greensock_example5.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <p>The starting width and height are very small for all of the items here. Using
                TweenLite.to, I increase their size over time, delaying some of the effects. Once the
                plant is done growing, I give the petals a thin border so we can see them, then
                slowly increase their size. Two of the petals are rotated; 40 degrees and -40 
                degrees, respectively, and they all have a gradient background. This presents a 
                more 3-Dimensional look!</p>
            <p>I also added in a reset button that returns things to their original
                position, and I added some code to move the sun across the sky. using what you
                know now, see if you can figure out the code for the sun!</p>
        </div>
