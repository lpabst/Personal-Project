        <p>Selections are made in JQuery using $('.classname /or/ #id'). 
            It is smart to store the selection in a variable so that each
            time your code needs to access that variable it doesn't have to
            look over your entire document to find it again.</p>
        <p>Once our box is selected, we have box1.click(function(){}). This means
            to listen for a click on box 1, then execute that function. In this case,
            our function checks the box's current size. If it is 40px tall, it changes
            the height and width to a larger size. Otherwise (meaning it has already
            been changed) it changes the width and height back to their original values.</p>
