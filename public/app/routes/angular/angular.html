            <h2>Learning Angular</h2>
            <p>A basic understanding of how Angular works is required for this tutorial.
                If you need help learning Angular, or a refresher, you can learn on
                <a href='http://codecademy.com' target='_blank'>Codecademy</a> or with
                <a href='https://youtube.com/results?search_query=angular' target='_blank'>
                Youtube Tutorials</a>. Here is a great video for reference:
            </p>

            <h2>Angular Directives</h2>
            <div class='examplebox' id='angular_box1' ng-click='showLeftBox = !showLeftBox' ng-show='showLeftBox'>Click Me!</div>
            <div class='examplebox' id='angular_box2' ng-click='showLeftBox = !showLeftBox' ng-hide='showLeftBox'>Click Me!</div>
            <p>This illustrates two of Angular's built in directives, ng-hide and ng-show. The first two 
                pictures show how to use both directives. The first div, the one on the left of the
                screen, has ng-show set to the scope variable 'showLeftBox'. So when that variable
                is true, the left box will 'show'. First, we add $scope.showLeftBox = true to our 
                Javascript. Then we add ng-show and ng-hide to our divs in our HTML.</p>

            <img src='./img/angular/angular_example2.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <p>The second div has ng-hide set to the same variable. So when that variable is true, div
                #2 will 'hide'. So one of these boxes will always be hidden, and one will always be
                showing.</p>
            <img src='./img/angular/angular_example3.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <p>This third picture shows how to switch the variable back and forth. Both divs have an 
                ng-click on them, which changes the variable to the opposite of what it was before 
                the click happened. ng-show, ng-hide, and ng-click are examples of built
                in directives in Angular. Built in directives make simple animations very easy to implement.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Custom Directives</h2>
            <p>We are somewhat limited, however, with built in directives. Only certain functionality has
                been built into the directives. For additional functionality, we can create our own 
                directives, which we can then add to any HTML element that we want!</p>
            <div class='angular_example_wrapper'>
                <div class='examplebox' id='angular_box3'>
                    <ul>
                        <li highlight-text>click me list item #1</li>
                        <li highlight-text>click me instead #2</li>
                        <li highlight-text>click repeatedly item #3</li>
                        <li highlight-text>click here too! item #4</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <img src='./img/angular/angular_example4.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
                <img src='./img/angular/angular_example4_html.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            </div>
            <div class='angular_example_wrapper'>
                <div class='examplebox' id='angular_box4' grow-shrink>Click to change</div>
                <img src='./img/angular/angular_example5.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
                <img src='./img/angular/angular_example5_html.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            </div>
            <p>Here we have two custom directives. The Javascript code is on top, and the HTML code is
                on bottom. Notice that once we have the javascript code set up, applying it to the HTML
                is as easy as typing in the name on your element. </p>
            <p>Setting up the directive itself is pretty easy. My app's name is tutorialSite, I am 
                assigning it a directive name 'highlightText', and returning an object with the 
                directive's instructions. **Note that HTML doesn't support camelCase, so in the HTML
                you must write it as 'highlight-text' instead. Angular will know that they are the same
                thing.</p>
            <p>Restrict 'A' means we will be using this directive as an attribute on HTML elements (A = 
                attribute). The link function is where the javascript logic takes place. We can see from
                these two examples how to affect CSS on any element. You can assign new classes, or affect
                the CSS directly!</p>

            <h2>More On Directives</h2>
            <p>Visual animations really aren't Angular's strongpoint. Angular is amazing at 
                being a framework. Keeping everything connected and information flowing back 
                and forth is a strongpoint for Angular.</p>
            <p>Since it isn't a visual animation, we won't get into it too much here, but I'll
                demonstrat one easy example of this. ng-model is an amazing tool for declaring 
                variables right in your HTML. Here is a simple example of ng-model in action:</p>
            <input ng-model='userInput' placeholder='type here' type='text'>
            <h3>{{ userInput }}</h3>
            <img src='./img/angular/angular_example6_html.PNG' alt='picture of code' style='margin-top: 5px'>
            <p>Whatever you type in that input box will be displayed right beneath it! ng-model 
                stores the input as a $scope variable, and we can access $scope variables using the 
                {{ }} double curly braces.</p>
            <p>Here is a real world use for this: </p>
            <form ng-submit="addItem()">
                <input ng-model='newItem'>
                <button type='submit'>Add</button>
            </form>
            <div class='angular_to_do_list'>
                <ul>
                    <li ng-repeat='item in toDoList track by $index'>
                        {{ item }}
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <img src='./img/angular/angular_example7.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <img src='./img/angular/angular_example7_html.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <p>The html sets up the structure for the list. ng-model captures the user input
                and saves it as a scope variable. A little bit of Javascript adds the item to 
                an array (list), and then we use an ng-repeat in the html to display every 
                item in the list. Pretty simple! Note - track by $index isn't necessary to 
                make this to-do list work, it just allows the list to contain the same item 
                more than once.</p>
            <p>There are many, many built in directives that are very powerful in the right
                situations. Custom directives also have much more potential that what we 
                discussed in this tutorial, but hopefully this helped increase your 
                understanding of how Angular directives can be used to animate/automate your
                website!</p>
