            <h2>Learning Angular</h2>
            <p>A basic understanding of how Angular works is required for this tutorial.
                If you need help learning Angular, or a refresher, you can learn on
                <a href='http://codecademy.com' target='_blank'>Codecademy</a> or with
                <a href='https://youtube.com/results?search_query=angular' target='_blank'>
                Youtube Tutorials</a>. Here is a great video for reference:
            </p>

            <h2>Angular Directives</h2>
            <div class='examplebox' id='angular_box1' ng-click='showLeftBox = !showLeftBox' ng-show='showLeftBox'>Click Me!</div>
            <div class='examplebox' id='angular_box2' ng-click='showLeftBox = !showLeftBox' ng-hide='showLeftBox'>Click Me!</div>
            <p>This illustrates two of Angular's built in directives, ng-hide and ng-show. The first two 
                pictures show how to use both directives. The first div, the one on the left of the
                screen, has ng-show set to the scope variable 'showLeftBox'. So when that variable
                is true, the left box will 'show'. First, we add $scope.showLeftBox = true to our 
                Javascript. Then we add ng-show and ng-hide to our divs in our HTML.</p>

            <img src='./img/angular/angular_example2.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <p>The second div has ng-hide set to the same variable. So when that variable is true, div
                #2 will 'hide'. So one of these boxes will always be hidden, and one will always be
                showing.</p>
            <img src='./img/angular/angular_example3.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <p>This third picture shows how to switch the variable back and forth. Both divs have an 
                ng-click on them, which changes the variable to the opposite of what it was before 
                the click happened. ng-show, ng-hide, and ng-click are examples of built
                in directives in Angular. Built in directives make simple animations very easy to implement.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Custom Directives</h2>
            <p>We are somewhat limited, however, with built in directives. Only certain functionality has
                been built into the directives. For additional functionality, we can create our own 
                directives, which we can then add to any HTML element that we want!</p>
            <div class='examplebox' id='angular_box3'>
                <ul>
                    <li highlight-text>Highlight list item #1</li>
                    <li highlight-text>Highlight list item #2</li>
                    <li highlight-text>Highlight list item #3</li>
                    <li highlight-text>Highlight list item #4</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class='examplebox' id='angular_box4' grow-shrink>Grow/Shrink</div>
            <p>Here we have two custom directives.</p>
            <img src='./img/angular/angular_example4.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <img src='./img/angular/angular_example5.PNG' alt='picture of code'>
            <p>The second div has ng-hide set to the same variable. So when that variable is true, div
                #2 will 'hide'. So one of these boxes will always be hidden, and one will always be
                showing.</p>

                ng-click on them, which changes the variable to the opposite of what it was before
