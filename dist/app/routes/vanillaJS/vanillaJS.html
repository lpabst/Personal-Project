            <h2>Javascript Animations</h2>
            <p>You should have a basic understanding of 
                HTML, CSS, & Javascript before starting
                this tutorial. If you need help learning,
                or a refresher on the basics, check out one
                of these great sites here:</p>

        <div class='js_animation_wrapper'>
            <h2>Click Events - Change Color</h2>
            <div class='js_examplebox' id='js_box1'>Click Me!</div>
            <img src='./img/js/example1.jpg'>
            <p id='js_first_top_p'>Here we have a simple function that checks the current
                background color when the box is clicked. If the current
                color is red, it changes it to blue. Otherwise, it changes
                it to red. </p>
            <p>Use - document.getElementById - to select the 
            element that will be used to trigger the event.</p>
            <p>Use - .addEventListener() - to describe which type of event
                you want to 'listen' for.</p>
        </div>

        <div class='js_animation_wrapper'>
            <h2>Mouseover Events - Change Element's Position</h2>
            <div class='js_examplebox' id='js_box2'>Hover Over Me!</div>
            <img src='./img/js/example2.jpg'>
            <p>Once again we are using document.getElementById to target
                our example box, in this case box2. We use another event
                listener, this time listening for 'mouseover'.  Once this
                happens, we set the position to absolute, and directly affect
                the 'left' attribute.
            </p>
            <p>'Click' and 'mouseover' are just two examples of the many
                Javascript events that can take place. 
                <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events' target='_blank'>
                Here is an extensive list</a> 
                of Javascript events for reference, go crazy!</p>
            <p>That was a bit jumpy though, wasn't it? Instead of moving over
                to the new location, the box just kinda 'jumps' there. In this
                next example, we'll take a look at how to smooth that out so 
                the transition seems more natural.
        </div>

        <div class='js_animation_wrapper'>
            <h2>Smooth Transitions</h2>
            <div class='js_examplebox' id='js_box3'>Hover Over Me!</div>
            <img src='./img/js/example3js.jpg'>
            <p>That first example was a bit jumpy, but this one moves gradually to
                the new location. You'll also notice that I added in some functionality
                that allows the box to move back and forth as many times as you want.</p>
            <img src='./img/js/example3css.jpg' id='example3_css'>
            <p>The key to smooth transitions actually lies in the CSS. Add this bit of 
                code to any element in CSS and any CSS changes will transition gradually
                over a 2 secone period. You can also put any amount of time that you want
                there, it doesn't have to be 2 seconds!</p>
        </div>

        <div class='js_animation_wrapper'>
            <h2>Change Content</h2>
            <div class='js_examplebox' id='js_box4'>This content changes</div>
            <input type='text' id='js_input' placeholder="type here">
            <button id='js_submit'>Submit</button>
            <p>Type a few words into the input box, then hit submit!</p>
            <img id='js_example4_code' src='./img/js/example4.jpg' alt='code'>
            <p>We target the elements with document.getElementById, then we wait for the
                submit button to be clicked. Once it is, we set the inner text of the target
                div to the value of whatever is currently in the input box.  We could also
                add some code to zero out the input box if we wanted: input.value = "" i.e.
                set it equal to an empty string!</p>
        </div>
